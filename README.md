# PingPongEasy
# Ping Pong Game  This is a simple implementation of the classic Ping Pong game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The game features a table with a bouncing ball, a player paddle, and a computer-controlled paddle. The objective of the game is to hit the ball with the paddle and prevent it from reaching your side of the table while trying to score points by making the ball pass the opponent's paddle.

How to Play
Open the HTML file in a web browser that supports HTML5 canvas.
The game starts automatically.
Move your mouse vertically to control the player paddle.
The computer-controlled paddle will try to follow the ball's movement.
Score points by making the ball pass the opponent's paddle.
The game continues indefinitely until you close the browser window.
Game Controls
Move your mouse vertically within the game window to control the player paddle.
There are no other controls in this game.
Game Features
The game table is represented by a canvas element with a border.
The ball is a green circle that moves and bounces around the table.
The player paddle is a red rectangle on the left side of the table.
The computer-controlled paddle is a red rectangle on the right side of the table.
The score for each player is displayed at the top of the table.
The separator in the middle of the table helps distinguish the sides.
Implementation Details
The game is implemented using JavaScript and HTML canvas. Here's a brief overview of the code structure:

The game elements (ball, player, computer paddle, separator) are defined as objects with their respective properties.
Various functions are defined to draw the game elements on the canvas.
The helper function is responsible for drawing the entire game scene by calling other drawing functions.
The restart function resets the ball's position and velocity when a point is scored.
The getMousePos function tracks the mouse movement to control the player paddle.
The detect_collision function checks if the ball collides with the player or computer paddle.
The updates function handles the game logic, including ball movement, paddle movement, collision detection, and score updates.
The call_back function is called repeatedly using setInterval to update and redraw the game at a fixed frame rate.
Future Improvements
This implementation serves as a basic version of the Ping Pong game. Here are some potential improvements and additions:

Improve computer-controlled paddle movement to make it more challenging.
Add sound effects and background music to enhance the gaming experience.
Implement levels of increasing difficulty by adjusting the speed or behavior of the ball or paddles.
Add a countdown timer or time limit to the game.
Implement a multiplayer mode, allowing two players to compete on the same computer.
Enhance the visual appearance of the game with better graphics, animations, and visual effects.
Feel free to experiment with the code and customize the game according to your preferences and ideas.
